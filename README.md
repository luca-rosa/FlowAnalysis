# FlowAnalysis

Install FlowCal with: _pip install FlowCal_

To run the script: _python mainFlow.py X_

X is the only accepted argument. It's the gating percentage (value between 20 and 90)
If no argument is given the default percentage is 50%

The script outputs one csv file per inducer. e.g. data_ahl.txt
